After reading Section 4.4 in the book Casella and Berger, Statistical Inference (2001), I would like to revisit this post.

The GWAS simulation setting, showed below, can be seen as a hierarchical model:

$$y=wu+e$$

, where

- $f \sim U(0.1, 0.5)$
- $x|f \sim Bin(2,f)$ (x is a binomial distribution condition on f)

- $w=\frac{x-2f}{\sqrt(2f(1-f))}$, so 
    - $E(w|f)=0$
    - $Var(w|f)=1$
    
- $u \sim N(0,1)$, so 
    - $E(wu|u,f)=uE(w|f)=u\times 0=0$
    - $Var(wu|u,f)=u^2Var(w|f)=u^2$
    - $E(wu)=E(E(wu|u,f)) = E(0)=0$
    - $Var(wu)=E(Var(wu|f,u))+Var(E(wu|f,u))=E(u^2)+Var(0)=1+0=1$
- $e \sim N(0, var(wu)[\frac{1}{h2}-1])$ (h2 is a parameter)

This provides a more detailed derivation about the mean and variance of $wu$ based on the conditional probability and the hierarchical model.
