[Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy%E2%80%93Weinberg_principle) and [Linkage disequilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkage_disequilibrium) are two basic concepts in [population genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics).

### Defination

- Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE): **allele and genotype frequencies** in a population will remain constant **from generation to generation** in the absence of other evolutionary influences.
- Linkage Disequilibrium (LD): the non-random association of **alleles at different loci** in a given population.

So HWE is about the allele and genotype frequencies in one locus, but LD is about alleles at different loci.

### Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium

#### From Genotype to Allele frequencies

For $n_{AA}, n_{Aa}, n_{aa}$ is the count of genotype AA, Aa and aa, respectively. And $n = n_{AA} + n_{Aa} + n_{aa}$.

So, the count of A and a alleles are:

$$n_{A} = 2 \times n_{AA} + n_{Aa}$$

$$n_{a} = 2 \times n_{aa} + n_{Aa}$$

The frequencies of A and a alleles are:

$$p_{A} = \frac{n_{A}}{2n} = \frac{2 \times n_{AA} + n_{Aa}}{2n} = p_{AA} + \frac{1}{2}p_{Aa}$$

$$p_{a} = \frac{n_{a}}{2n} = \frac{2 \times n_{aa} + n_{Aa}}{2n} = p_{aa} + \frac{1}{2}p_{Aa}$$

$$p_{A} = 1 - p_{a}$$

#### From Allele to Genotype frequencies - HWE

We cannot directly get genotype frequencies from allele frequencies. But under Hardy-Weiberge Equilibrium, we can do it by

$$p_{AA} = p_{A}^{2}$$

$$p_{Aa} = 2p_{A}p_{a}$$

$$p_{aa} = p_{a}^{2}$$

The assumptions for HWE includes:

- random mating
- infinite population size (no genetic drift)
- no mutation
- no selection
- no migration

In addition, we can see genotype frequencies is a binomial distribution. If SNP genotpes are coded X = 0, 1 and 2 (alleles) and the allele frequency is p, then:

$$ X \sim B(2, p)\text{ with }E(X) = 2p\text{ and }Var(X)=2p(1-p)$$

We can plot the distribution of three different genotypes. In real genetics, we usually use the minor allele, so p is less than 0.5.

```{r}
p = seq(0,1,0.01)
plot(p, p^2, ylab = "genotype frequency", main="Under HWE",type="l", col="blue")
lines(p, 2*p*(1-p), col="green")
lines(p, (1-p)^2, col="grey")
legend(0.5,0.95,"genotype = 0",lty = 1, col ="blue", bty="n")
legend(0.5,0.85,"genotype = 1",lty = 1, col ="green", bty = "n")
legend(0.5,0.75,"genotype = 2",lty = 1, col ="grey", bty = "n")
abline(v = 0.5, lty=2)
```

#### Test for HWE

In the GWAS QC step, we usually remove SNPs with extensive deviation from HWE because this can be indicative of a genotyping or genotype-calling error.

The two common ways to test HWE are Chi-square test and exact test.

For Chi-square test:

$$\chi^{2} = \frac{(n_{AA}-e{AA})^2}{e_{AA}} + \frac{(n_{Aa}-e{Aa})^2}{e_{Aa}} + \frac{(n_{aa}-e{aa})^2}{e_{aa}}$$

where $e_{AA} = np_{A}^2$, $e_{Aa} = 2np_{A}p_{a}$, $e_{aa} = np_{a}^2$ and df = 1 (#genotype - #allele).

For exact test:

$$P(N_{Aa}|N_{A}) = \frac{n_{A}!n_{a}!n!2^{n_{Aa}}}{\frac{1}{2}(n_{A}-n_{Aa})!n_{Aa}!\frac{1}{2}(n_{a}-n_{Aa})!(2n)!}$$

For example, a sample with 2504 individuals, the observed genotypes are 2467/36/1 for AA, Aa and aa. We can do the chi-square test in R.

```r
### Observed genotype counts
n_AA = 2467
n_Aa = 36
n_aa = 1
n = n_AA + n_Aa + n_aa
O_geno = c(n_AA, n_Aa, n_aa)
cat(O_geno)
```

```
## 2467 36 1
```

```r
### Observed allele count and frequency
n_A = n_AA * 2 + n_Aa
n_a = n_aa * 2 + n_Aa
p_A = n_A/(2 * n)
p_a = n_a/(2 * n)
cat(p_A, p_a)
```

```
## 0.9924121 0.007587859
```

```r
### Expected genotype count, under HWE
E_AA = p_A^2 * n
E_Aa = 2 * p_A * p_a *  n
E_aa = p_a^2 * n
E_geno = c(E_AA, E_Aa, E_aa)
cat(E_geno)
```

```
## 2466.144 37.71166 0.1441693
```

```r
### Chi-square with df=1 (#genotypes - #alleles)
chisq = sum((O_geno-E_geno)^2/E_geno)
pvalue = 1 - pchisq(chisq, 1)
cat(paste("chisq:", chisq, ";","pvalue: ", pvalue))
```

```
## chisq: 5.15844350552391 ; pvalue:  0.02313362043297
```

We can also use the R package "HardyWeinberg" to do the chi-square test.

```r
### We can also use the R package "HardyWeinberg"
library(HardyWeinberg)
HWChisq(O_geno, cc=0)
```

```
## Chi-square test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (autosomal)
## Chi2 =  5.158444 DF =  1 p-value =  0.02313362 D =  -0.8558307 f =  0.04538812
```

It's hard to do the exact test directly in R because of the factorial calucation. So we also use the R package "HardyWeinberg". A more common way is to use [PLINK](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/filter#hwe) "--hwe" option.

```r
HWExact(O_geno)
```

```
## Haldane Exact test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (autosomal)
## using SELOME p-value
## sample counts: n =  2467 n =  36 n =  1 
## H0: HWE (D==0), H1: D <> 0 
## D =  -0.8558307 p-value =  0.1318891
```
