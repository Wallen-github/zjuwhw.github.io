## 基本概念

- MongoDB: an open-source document database
- ORM: Object Relational Mapping
- Documents: a record in MongoDB, similar to JSON objects
- Collections: MongoDB stores documents in collections, analogous to tables in relational databases
- _id field: unique, acts as a primary key
- [JSON](http://www.json.org/): JavaScript Object Notation
- BSON: a binary representation of JSON documents
- CRUD: create, read, update, and delete documents
- drivers: an application communicates with MongoDB by way of a client library, including shell, python, C, java, Node.js, etc.

## [MongoDB Package Componets](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/)

- `mongod`: the primary daemon process(守护进程) for the MongoDB system
- `mongos`: MongoDB Shard. Sharding means a method for distributing data across multiple machines.
- `mongo`: **an interactive JavaScript shell interface to MongoDB**
- `mongodump`: a utility for creating a binary export of the contents of a database
- `mongorestore`: writes data from a binary database dump created by mongodump to a MongoDB instance.
- `bsondump`: converts BSON files into human-readable formats, including JSON.
- `mongooplog`: a simple tool that polls operations from the replication oplog of a remote server, and applies them to the local server. 
- `mongoimport`: imports content from an Extended JSON, CSV, or TSV export created by mongoexport, or potentially, another third-party export tool.
- `mongoexport`: a utility that produces a JSON or CSV export of data stored in a MongoDB instance.
- `mongostat`: provides a quick overview of the status of a currently running mongod or mongos instance
- `mongotop`: provides a method to track the amount of time a MongoDB instance spends reading and writing data
- `mongosniff`: provides a low-level operation tracing/sniffing view into database activity in real time
- `mongoperf`: a utility to check disk I/O performance independently of MongoDB
- `mongofiles`: makes it possible to manipulate files stored in your MongoDB instance in GridFS objects from the command line.


## [MongoDB CRUD Operations](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/crud/)

### Create Operations

add new documents to a collection

```
db.collection.insert()
db.collection.insertOne()
db.collection.insertMany() 
```

### Read Operations

read documents from a collection, i.e. queries a collection for documents

```
db.collection.find()
```

### Update Operations

modify existing documents in a collection

```
db.collection.update()
db.collection.updateOne()
db.collection.updateMany()
db.collection.replaceOne()
```
### Delete Operations

remove documents from a collection

```
db.collection.remove()
db.collection.deleteOne()
db.collection.deleteMany()
```
