Since developed in about [2007](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7145/full/nature05911.html), [GWAS (Genome-wide association study)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study) has gained an [increasing attention](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v546/n7658/full/546360a.html) in biological research. Apart from the standard association analysis, an increasing number of novel statisical analysis methods are developed to gain more knowledge, such as:

- $h^2_{SNP}$: the heritability estimation
- $r_G$: genetic correlation between traits
- PRS: polygenic risk score to predict the genetic risk
- MR: Mendelian randomisation
- Fine-mapping
- integrating with other type of data (such as eQTL etc.)


There are two great reviews from [my lab](http://cnsgenomics.com/) for this part of filed, so I just write the relavant content down here.
