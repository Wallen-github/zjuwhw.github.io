## 测试

- Unit test（单元测试）: Specify and test one point of the contract of single method of a class. This should have a very narrow and well defined scope. Complex dependencies and interactions to the outside world are stubbed or mocked.
- Integration test（集成测试）: Test the correct inter-operation of multiple subsystems. There is whole spectrum there, from testing integration between two classes, to testing integration with the production environment.
- Smoke test (aka Sanity check，冒烟测试): A simple integration test where we just check that when the system under test is invoked it returns normally and does not blow up. It is an analogy with electronics, where the first test occurs when powering up a circuit: if it smokes, it's bad.
- Regression test（回归测试）: A test that was written when a bug was fixed. It ensure that this specific bug will not occur again. The full name is "non-regression test". It can also be a test made prior to changing an application to make sure the application provides the same outcome.

## 软件
- **Bootstrap** is a free and open-source collection of tools for creating websites and web applications. It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions.
- **Django**:  Django (/ˈdʒæŋɡoʊ/ jang-goh)[4] is a free and open-source web framework, written in Python, which follows the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
- **Flask** is a micro web framework written in Python and based on the Werkzeug toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. It is BSD licensed.
- **Jinja2** is a full featured template engine for Python. It has full unicode support, an optional integrated sandboxed execution environment, widely used and BSD licensed.
- **Nginx**: Nginx (pronounced "engine x") is a web server. It can act as a reverse proxy server for HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP protocols, as well as a load balancer and an HTTP cache.
- **MongoDB**: is a cross-platform document-oriented database. Classified as a NoSQL database, MongoDB eschews the traditional table-basedrelational database structure in favor of JSON-like documents with dynamicschemas (MongoDB calls the format BSON), making the integration of data in certain types of applications easier and faster.
- **The Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI)** is a specification for simple and universal interface between web servers and web applications or frameworks for thePython programming language.
- **Splunk** is an American multinational corporation based in San Francisco, California, that produces software for searching, monitoring, and analyzing machine-generated big data, via a web-style interface.
- **Travis CI** is a FOSS, hosted, distributed[2] continuous integration service used to build and test software projects hosted atGitHub.[3]
- **Sun Grid Engine (SGE)**, CODINE (Computing in Distributed Networked Environments) or GRD (Global Resource Director),[2] was a grid computing computer cluster software system (otherwise known as batch-queuing system), acquired as part of a purchase of Terraspring,[3] then improved and supported by Sun Microsystems and later Oracle.
- **Gunicorn** "Green Unicorn" is a Python Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) HTTP server.
- **YAML** (/ˈjæməl/, rhymes with camel) is a human-readable data serialization language that takes concepts from programming languages such as C, Perl, and Python, and ideas from XML and the data format of electronic mail
- **JSON**: an open-standardformat that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs.
- **RESTful**: In computing, representational state transfer (REST) is the software architectural style of the World Wide Web
- **OpenSSL**: In computer networking, OpenSSL is a software library to be used in applications that need to secure communications against eavesdropping or need to ascertain the identity of the party at the other end.
- **RSA** is one of the first practical public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission
- **OpenSSH**, also known as OpenBSD Secure Shell,[a] is a suite of security-related network-level utilities based on the SSH protocol, which help to secure network communications via the encryption of network traffic over multiple authentication methods and by providing secure tunneling capabilities.[4]
