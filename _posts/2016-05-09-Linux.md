注：本位为Linux系统的学习笔记，内容来自图书[《Beginning Linux Programming》](https://book.douban.com/subject/2361237/)

## Get Started

- Unix: originally developed at Bell Laboratories, designed in the 1970s.
- Unix-like systems:
	- some available commercially: IBM's AIX, HP’s HP-UX, and Sun’s Solaris
	- some available for free: FreeBSD and Linux
- Linux: freely distributed implementation of a UNIX-like kernel.
- GNU: stands for the recursive GNU's Not UNIX
- GPL: GNU General Public License
- softwares from the GNU project under GPL:
	- GCC: The GNU Compiler Collection, containing the GNU C compiler
	- G++: A C++ compiler, included as part of GCC
	- GDB: A source code-level debugger
	- GNU maker: A version of UNIX make
	- Bison: A parser generator compatible with UNIX yacc
	- bash: A command shell
	- GNU Emacs: A text editor and environment
- `PATH`: 
	- /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin
	- /sbin, /usr/sbin (system administration program)
	- /opt (optional operating system components and third-party applications)
- Header Files
	- provide definitions of constants and declarations for system and library function calls
	- /usr/include
- Library Files
	- collections of precompiled functions
	- standard system libaries: /lib, /usr/lib
	- .a for traditional, static libraries
	- .so for shared libraries
- gcc
	- `-o` write output to <file>
	- `-I` use header files in subdirectories or nonstandard places
	- `-l`
	- `-L`
- Static libraries
- Shared Libraries
- Getting help: `man gcc`和`info gcc`

## Shell Programming

### shell and bash

- A *shell* is a program that acts as the interface between you and the Linux system, enabling you to enter commands for the operating system to execute.
- In linux, the standard shell that is always installed as `/bin/sh` is called *bash* (the GNU Bourne-Again SHell), from the GNU suite of tools.

### Pipes and Redirection
- file descriptor:
	- `0`: standard input to a program
	- `1`: standard output
	- `2`: standard error
- Redirecting Output
	- `>`: redirect the standard output into a file
	- `>>`: append the standard output into a file

```
#分开output和error信息
kill 1234 >killout.txt 2>killerr.txt

#利用>&结合output和error信息
kill 1234 >killouterr.txt 2>&1

#利用/dev/null扔掉输出
kill 1234 >/dev/null 2>&1
```

- Redirecting Input

```
more < killout.txt
```
但是这看起来并没有什么太大的用处。

- Pipes

```
 ps –xo comm | sort | uniq | grep -v sh | more
```

### Shell Programming

- *shell script*: store commands in a file
