## 基本概念：

- **The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**: an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.
- **Client-server model**: a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.
- **Request–response (or request–reply)**: one of the basic methods computers use to communicate with each other, in which the first computer sends a request for some data and the second computer responds to the request.
- **REST (representational state transfer)** is an architectural style used for web development.

## Request Methods/Verbs（动词）：

- GET: Send named resource from the server to the client. （获取）
- POST: Send client data into a server gateway application.（创建）
- PUT: Store data from client into a named server resource. (更新)
- DELETE: Delete the named resource from a server. （删除）
- HEAD: Send just the HTTP headers from the response for the named resource.
- OPTIONS

## Headers（头）

**HTTP header fields** are components of the header section of request and response messages in the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
